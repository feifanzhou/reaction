Reaction
========

Flux + React + Pushstate navigation


============
Currently supports pushstate navigation. See repo wiki for documentation. 

Include build/reaction.js in your project (bottom of page) and initialize the router. Make sure to include React before Reaction (pick your flavor of React â€” full, minified, with or without addons). 

Reaction includes support for npm-style packages
`require(reaction.js)`
