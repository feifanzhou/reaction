<h1>Reaction</h1>

<p>Flux + React + Pushstate navigation</p>

<hr />

<p>Currently supports pushstate navigation. See repo wiki for documentation.</p>

<p>Include build/reaction.js in your project (bottom of page) and initialize the router. Make sure to include React before Reaction (pick your flavor of React â€” full, minified, with or without addons).</p>

<p>Reaction includes support for npm-style packages
<code>require(reaction.js)</code></p>
